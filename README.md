# Johnny_Data project:
## Training Neural Networks
This project is comprised of several data sources which are intended to be used to predict stock prices.  The initial benefit is not actually expected to be successful in accurately predicting stock prices, but rather it is intended to be a training source to identify human language elements associated with advise on buying or selling stock from various types of publications.  Neural networks will be trained on word vectors to identify a spectrum of vocabulary associated with advise to buy or sell stock.
