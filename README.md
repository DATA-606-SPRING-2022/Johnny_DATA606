# Johnny_Data project:
## Training Neural Networks
This project is comprised of several data sources which are intended to be used to predict stock prices.  The initial benefit is not actually expected to be successful in accurately predicting stock prices, but rather it is intended to be a training source to identify human language elements associated with advise on buying or selling stock from various types of publications.  Neural networks will be trained on word vectors to identify a spectrum of vocabulary associated with advise to buy or sell stock.  

current status: 
learning how to run github on my operating system directory on my laptop.  

Successfuklly loaded directory updates from laptop bash terminal.  

uploaded directory structures assocoated with several of my data sets.

current level of data file access includes successful Google search, successful newspaper3k parsing.  

Next steps include activating my twitter research account, developing a daily search strcuture to control 1 year of daily retrospective search criteria for google searches.  

develop parsing methodology to take resulting urls, associate target dates to the data points, develop newspaper3k parsing of each url, capture metadata of each url into data frame, store resulting data frames into directory structure.
